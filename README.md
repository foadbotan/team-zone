## Technologies Used

- Next.js: A popular React framework for building web applications.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- Zod: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
- Luxon: A powerful library for working with dates and times in JavaScript.
- useQueryState: An open-source Next.js hook that stores React state in the URL for persistence and sharing.

## Approach Taken

The application was built using a component-based approach, leveraging the power of React and Next.js. The UI state is stored in the URL, allowing users to share a link to a specific timezone view without signing up or logging in. This is achieved using the useQueryState hook from the next-usequerystate package.

## Running Tests

The application uses Jest and Testing Library for testing. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm run test` to execute the tests.

## Unsolved Problems

Currently, there are no unsolved problems in the project. However, future enhancements could include the ability to persist team member data using a backend database and user authentication for personalized team management.
